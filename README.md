# Product App

A mini React application focused on performance optimization, clean architecture,
and scalable state management using modern React patterns.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This Product App demonstrates how to build a performant and predictable UI in React
by applying best practices such as memoization, URL-based state management,
and feature-based project structure.

---

## 🎯 Key Concepts

- Performance optimization with `useCallback` and `useMemo`
- Search and filter state synchronization using URL query parameters
- Clean separation of concerns using custom hooks
- Feature-based and scalable project structure
- Type-safe development with TypeScript

---

## ✨ Features

- Product search and filtering
- URL query-based state persistence (`useSearchParams`)
- Optimized re-render behavior
- Reusable layout components
- Custom hooks for data fetching and logic separation

---

## 🚀 Performance Optimization

- `useCallback` is used to keep function references stable and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- `useMemo` memoizes computed product lists to avoid expensive recalculations
- Improved UI responsiveness during search and filter operations
